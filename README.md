# E-CommerceJavaSpring

An online apparel store using servlets. The store keeps records of its items in a database where
some items may be discounted and others should be displayed as “new arrivals”. A user may
search for a specific item. By default, when a user signs in, based on his/her profile (male/female etc.),
show him/her preferred set of clothing. Users will be divided into two groups: some users are looking for
seasonal clothing items, and others are looking for new arrivals. So, depending on their preference
already set in the database, their shopping experience would be different. Show the user products of the
price range based on his/her purchase history.
