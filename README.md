# E-CommerceJavaSpring

Design an online apparel store using servlets. The store keeps records for its items in a database where
some items may be discounted and some other items should be displayed as “new arrivals”. A user may
search for a specific item. By default, when a user signs in, based on his/her profile (male/female etc.),
show him/her preferred set of clothing. Users will be divided into two groups: some users looking for
seasonal clothing items mainly, some others looking for new arrivals. So, depending on their preference
already set in the database, their shopping experience would be different. Show the user products of the
price range based on his/her purchase history.
You may apply the concept of session and cookies for tracking user behaviour. Build this application using
